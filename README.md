<h1 align="center">Procedural City in UE 5</h1>
<h3 align="center">A procedurally generated infinite city in UE 5</h3>

**Concept:**

This is an artistic project we undertook for our procedural graphics class. Since we all liked manga, we decided to recreate the appearance and atmosphere of BLAME! using Houdini and Unreal Engine 5.

**My Team:**

I created this with two other people from my class, Lewis Ghrist and Christina Qiu.

<br>

**My Roles in the process:**

* Design:

  * Postprocess shader with screen tearing, black boxes and translucent magnification effect
  
  * Sound design
 
  * Atmospheric feel
    
* Development:

	* Integration of Houdini fbx with Unreal environmental elements like fog and lighting.

  * Two exploration modes

	* Cinematic camera movement
 
  * Unreal lighting

<br>

**Challenges:**

* Houdini itegration
  
  * Integrating houdini with UE 5 was somewhat difficult because we didn't have the right versions
 
* Unreal pipeline
 
  * The Unreal pipeline was new to most of us, so it took some time for us to learn and use it
